	<p class="text-description-right">User acceptance testing (UAT) is the last phase of the software testing process. 
	During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios, according to specifications. 
	UAT is one of the final and critical software project procedures that must occur before newly developed software is rolled out to the market. </p>

	<p class="text-description-left">Performance testing is the process of determining the speed or effectiveness of a computer, network, software program or device. 
	This process can involve quantitative tests done in a lab, such as measuring the response time or the number of MIPS (millions of instructions per second) at which a system functions. 
	Qualitative attributes such as reliability, scalability and interoperability may also be evaluated. 
	Performance testing is often done in conjunction with stress testing.</p>
