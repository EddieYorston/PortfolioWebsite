      <h3>Teesside University</h3>
			<p>Completed - BSc (Hons) Computer and Digital Forensics (3 year), 
			during my time on this degree I have had exposure to a range of technologies used in the current industry. 
			This had enabled me to decide on the path in my final year to develop and create a project
			with the help of academic and labortory staff to understand areas of science and technology that were not in the scope of my degree,
			and branch into other interesting scientific elements.

			<h3>Gateshead College</h3>
			<p>Completed - Extended Diploma in System Support (2 year), When studying at Gateshead College the course content 
			enabled me to develop and further my knowledge in technology specifically System Support. The main areas that I have enjoyed were testing and working with hardware, 
			what i found interesting was understanding how the components inside a computer were pieced together and operated. 
			With having an inquizitive mind I enjoy even watching thing break and working out how to get it back working again. </p>
